# Password Generator with C

As a first personal project, I decided to start with something simple, such as a password generator.

This program will allow the user to generate a password with the option of using
Special Characters, Numeric/Alphanumeric Characters, Set password length, and the option to save the password to a specified directory.

With this project, I aim to utlize enterprise level practices with releases, branches, bug fixes, and more.

Any and all feedback would be, and is, greatly appreciated!
